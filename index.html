                            <h2>Clarence's Journey</h2>
                            <br>Meet Clarence Sylvester, an oil industry and nonprofit sector trailblazer who discovered
                            he had two superpowers. Born into a family of 13 children on a farm in rural Louisiana,
                            Clarence's path to success always seemed paved with perseverance and spiritual
                            conviction. But it was his near-death experience that provided the divine receipts.
                            After being revived from cardiac arrest, Clarence's first word was "JESUS," and he
                            realized then he hadn’t just been lucky in his ascent from those humble beginnings—God
                            had a unique formula for his life.</br><br>

                            Clarence's life has always been a beautiful blend of challenges, professional triumphs,
                            and personal joys. After traveling the globe as a pioneering manager in the oil
                            industry, Clarence played a pivotal role in establishing the Greater Georgia Black
                            Chamber of Commerce, an unwavering community champion for African American small
                            businesses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, his efforts paid off as the Black Chamber
                            became one of the first responders to small businesses, providing vital support and
                            resources to those in need. <br><br>
                            In tandem, Clarence and his wife Melinda, with whom he's shared 40 years of marriage, built
                            a life filled with love, purpose, and legacy. Together, they raised two incredible children,
                            Clara and Julius, and created a thriving business partnership through Tel-Mel Media &
                            Publishing Co, LLC, and Faith & Soul News Magazine. And it was his twin superpowers that
                            enabled him to toggle on these triumphs and the life-giving stability and balance they
                            created—for his family, and countless others.
